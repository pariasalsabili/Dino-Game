# Dino-Game
This project is a simple browser-based "Dino Jump" game, inspired by classic obstacle-avoiding games. It features a character (representing a dinosaur) that can jump to avoid an approaching block. The game is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy for beginners to understand and modify.
